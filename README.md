# Quick messages

A website for communication is an ideal place for those who want to talk on any subject. It provides a user-friendly interface, quick access to information and the ability to create subjects and chats to communicate with other users.

React and TypeScript are used to create a beautiful and functional interface. The Chakra-UI library is used to create stylish components that allow you to easily customize the appearance of the site. And Supabase is used as the server.
